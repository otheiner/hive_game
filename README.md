# Hive game

WIP: This is my Python implementation of Hive board game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game)). I have three goals in this project:
  - [x] implement the game
  - [ ]  write different agents (using different algorithms) which will be able to play the game
  - [ ] learn some new machine learning techniques when writing these AIs

The snapshot of the first version of a very simple game display is shown below.

## How to run the game?
Just clone this repository to your local machine and run:
```
python3 hive_game.py
```
This will open the game window and you can play. Have fun!
