# Hive game

WIP: This is my Python implementation of Hive board game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game)). I have two goals in this project:
  - implement the game
  - write different AIs to be able to play the game
  - learn some new machine learning techniques when writing these AIs

The snapshot of the first version of a very simple game display is shown below.
