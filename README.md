# Hive game

WIP: This is my Python implementation of Hive board game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game)). I have three goals in this project:
  - [ ] implement the game
  - [ ]  write different agents (using different AIs) which will be able to play the game
  - [ ] learn some new machine learning techniques when writing these AIs

The snapshot of the first version of a very simple game display is shown below.
